These are the materials for my finaly project. The data set is from a sample of 1,122 street food vendors in Dar es Salaam. 
The .dta file contains some key information as well as their estimates of the surrounding cluster size of food vendors. 
In this project we will use GPS coordinates obtained during interviews to see how accurate vendors' estimates of 2024 cluster sizes were.
